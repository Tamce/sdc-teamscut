    <h1>Team SCUT</h1>
    <p>
      Team SCUT is a team consist of multiple force including National Key Laboratory of Subtropical Architectural Science, Digital Laboratory construction, South China University of Technology Institute of Architectural Design and Luminous State Key Laboratory of Materials and Devices. Those supports provide us with a firm foundation of research, technology and hardware devices. These infrastructures are favorable conditions that lead to successful I mplementation of our project.

    <p class="no-indent"><b>(1) National Key Laboratory of Subtropical Architectural Science</b></p>
    <p>
      Approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology to establish the National Key Laboratory of subtropical architecture science, it is the only national key laboratory in the field of architecture in Colleges and universities in China.The laboratory currently has three experimental centers: architectural design science, architectural technology science and architectural engineering technology. They include modern architectural creation, ecological city and green building, digital media technology, GIS technology, traditional architectural culture and protection, building thermal environment and building energy conservation, architectural acoustics, architectural optics, building structure and defense. There are 13 sub-laboratories for disaster reduction, construction monitoring and health monitoring, geotechnical and underground structures, urban and rural environmental engineering sub-laboratories, etc. It has 1107 sets of advanced scientific research instruments and 80 fixed researchers.
